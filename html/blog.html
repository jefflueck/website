          <h2>Inside, Outside, Upside-Down</h2>

          <p>Now I know everyone has their own method for solving a problem. I also understand there are many articles that reference different developed methods to solve problems. I do not claim to know them all or even able to tell you what is best to use. I also think that for different problems you may choose to use a different approach each time. I have created my own method based on the very popular kids book inside, outside, upside-down written by Dr. Suess. I use the words in the title of this book to step through a problem. For the purposes of this article I will use an example problem of looking at making a website compatible across as many devices as possible.</p>

          <p>Now applying it to the case above I would start from inside my particular problem. My first step would be doing a code review. Are there different coding methods, tags, or even coding structure that would help me to solve part of this issue? At this point I am looking inside the code which is going to be served to the client and used to display the content to the user. The code is the inside part of the problem. I consider it the inside of the problem because it is at the core of what is being used to display content. The refining of the code which is at the heart of what is being used is the first layer in my problem. It is also where I can make the most impact to solving this problem.</p>

          <p>Now let’s move to the outside concept of looking at the problem. We have now looked at the code and done our review. Once we have exhausted this and determined that the code is clean we can look outside for more solutions. Here I would look at adding an outside library of code to see if that also helps to solve my problem. Is there a framework, a library, or plugin that helps solve some of these issues? In coding we see there are some specific tools created to help solve this very problem. Some do it very well and some do not. Now I need to do some research here and find the right fit for this particular problem. I also need to make sure it does not come at a performance cost to the user experience. This is the outside solution to the problem. I call it the outside solution because I am using an outside tool to help solve my issue.</p>

          <p>Lastly if all else fails I move to the upside-down concept of looking at this problem. In this step I have already done the inside and outside fix. I have cleaned the code. I have pulled together the best tools, concepts, methods, and best practices I can. Now I need to flip the problem upside-down. This step requires a lot of questions and analysis to happen. I need to take a step back from our problem and look from a higher level. At my job my chief calls this getting at 10,000 feet and looking at the problem. That’s is what we are trying to do here. I need to start asking myself some questions. Is there a problem I am missing with this issue? Have I really chosen the best tools to solve this particular problem? Have I thrown to many tools at this issue and created a bigger problem? Has anyone else tried to solve the same problem before? Do I need to have others look at my problem to see if they can identify an issue I am missing? Can the issue even in the end be solved completely? In this step my questions might grow as we look at the problem upside-down. I might find that answering some of those questions prompt different questions, or even expose new problems. I have found in this step asking peers for help and advice goes a long way. I have also found that when you take a high-level look at a problem I find there are obvious problems I probably missed.</p>

          <p>In the end of working through a problem I find that having a methodical process produces better results. I am not saying that this is the only way, or even the best way. I have found that most problems I have to work through can be solved more efficiently by having a method in place. I find it works well in my fire department career, my web development work, and even in working though life’s challenges. Now I know in this example I worked off a very particular problem, but you can apply these same concepts to your particular problem as well. I also understand there are many different methods you can use to solve a problem and I only am trying to give you this as another tool. I am not saying it is the fix all either. I have found for me this type of method for looking at a problem works well for myself. I only hope it can be a help to you as well.</p>

            <h2>Are you ever truly ready?</h2>
            <br>
            <time>4/15/2017</time>

            <p>As I continue to learn the endless web technologies this is a question I have wondered about.  Even wondering if I am holding myself back with how I have answered this question for myself at times.</p>

            <p>Now anyone in web technology and its related fields will tell you, if you wait until you are ready it will probably not happen, because it changes so fast.  Thinking about this has given me a new focus on learning.  More importantly to focus on the importance of continued learning, and drive myself harder.  It has caused me to not accept, “I just can’t do this”.  To know when to reach out to my development community, and fellow developers.  To be very appreciative of how willing the community is in building each other up in knowledge, and encouragement.</p>

            <p>All the technology used to make web applications, mobile applications, and a blend of all technologies in between will change faster than you can keep up.  What will not change is the concepts of how the various technologies accomplish a task.  The different technologies behave differently depending on the interface it is working with, and what it is trying to accomplish.  The thing that stays the same is, at the end of the day they all are trying to accomplish a lot of the same goals.  Usually, they are trying to improve the UI/UX for the user, performance, and ease of use for the developer employing them.  Allowing the developer to build faster, leaner, and more robust performance based products for their customers.</p>

            <p>So, in the next steps of my journey, I answer the title of this blog with a no.  What I can say is that I am ready to continue to learn, push my boundaries, be uncomfortable, and drive to become proficient with the next technology that I want to use.  In my experience, I find this to be the natural course of development when working with web technologies.  I have also experienced the huge feeling of accomplishment when you finish a working build using those technologies.  Going forward I am excited to build amazing products to solve new problems. </p>

            <h2>Mentorship is everyone’s responsibility</h2>
            <br>
            <time>9/6/2017</time>

            <p>When I think about my current career and my recent venture in learning web development, I see so many mentor’s that helped me get to where I am today.  Some of those were supervisors, co-workers, family, friends, instructors, and so many more.</p>

            <p>As I think about those individuals, I see a lot of people truly invested in my success.  I see co-workers, who decided through their own merit to teach me so much.  Those individuals had no obligation to invest in me, and honestly were not compensated to do so.  They had made the personnel decision to help make me, and in turn us the best we could be.  They decided that somewhere along the way the knowledge they were given should go on.  My supervisors also invested in my success because they also wanted the same success for me.  Even though my supervisors were compensated to do this, none of them did it for that reason.</p>

            <p>Therefore, I challenge you regardless of your position to make the same commitment to the people you work with, so that you, your co-workers, and your team can become the best in their industry.</p>

            <p>The rest of the individuals made that same commitment to my success because they have a heart for it.  More importantly those relationships have produced a true empathy in buying into my success.  They have chosen to sacrifice to their time, energy, and so much more.  They have made my success become part of their success.  This has caused me to want to work harder, and to be the best I can be.  It caused me to not accept failure, but harden my resolve to accomplish great things.</p>

            <p>So, I ask you to think about being a mentor to the people around you.  Now that does not mean you should have all the answers, or they can’t see you struggle.  It does mean you must be willing to continue to learn and grow.  It also means that you have made a mental commitment to help make the person next to you be the best they can be.  It means helping, encouraging, a lot of listening, and mostly empathy.</p>

            <p>It is easy to forget what it was like to be the new guy or girl on the block in something.  It’s also hard to remember how many people saw you in those unsure moments, but chose to use the opportunity to help you achieve that hurdle.  Therefore, I ask you to help make the person next to you to be the best they can be, and you will find it will cause you to be better than you expected you could be.</p>

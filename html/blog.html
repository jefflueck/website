          <h2>Embrace the Mistake</h2>
          <br>
          <time>2/22/2018</time>

          <p>I know that this blog might be a little controversial.  I know this is a topic that has a wide array of thoughts and very different opinions. Now I am going to start by saying that I do not have all the answers. These are only my observations and opinions based on my experience as an employee and a supervisor. This article is also not the end all or could ever hold all of answers. I am sure if you google this topic you will find many articles about this topic and I am sure they will very drastically. I am only bringing some food for thought on the topic.</p>

          <p>That being said I know what you are thinking, why would I want to embrace a mistake. I think there a couple good reasons to embrace a mistake. In this blog article I am going to explore a couple of reasons from two perspectives. The first of these being from the manager perspective. The second from the employee perspective.</p>

          <p>As a manager you are probably thinking "I don't want my employees to make a mistake." Or "That's going to cost me money and production time." Maybe even "This reflects badly on our company image and does not portray confidence." Now all of these are valid, here is my challenge to you. As the manager lets break down the mistake.</p>

          <p>First what is the gravity of the mistake. Was it as severe as we lost a long-term client? Contrastingly was it as minor as we have to redo a section of the product and maybe delay the product delivery. Both of these have different silver linings. The first being if we lose a long-term client over that particular mistake was worth keeping the client. Now let's break that down. If we have a long-term client and we have produced quality products for them in the past, what did we lose. Now don't get me wrong we do not want not want to lose them. An established client is bread and butter, but if the trust is so thin that we have a bad performance over a long span of time do we need that client. Now this is still a pain point and I am not trying to say that it is not significant. We want to avoid this as much as humanly possible. There is a silver lining to this it might make room for an even bigger, better client. Now internally in the company is chastising the employee who overall has produced good product worth losing. Good reliable, happy, dedicated employees who want to improve themselves are hard to replace. These are decisions as a manager that are hard to see without emotion and not easy to make. Let's look at the second example was this mistake a blessing in disguise and did we catch that before rollout to the client in turn producing a better product. We see this a lot in the web browser and website redesign world. What once had bugs gets a patch and a new suite of features. It is not possible to catch every mistake even with the best code review and testing out there. Now even though we have to tell the client "Sorry we need another day to polish your app" might hurt, in the end it makes a better product. This in turn wow's your client and they become a repeat customer. Now we have another possible long-term client and our company becomes more stable. The more of these we can work through together without shaming each other, the better the team becomes. The less this potentially happens and by nature everyone grows from it. As a manager at the end of the day is this not what we want? We want solid, trustworthy, honest employees who help us all grow together.</p>

          <p>Now as an employee you might be thinking "I can't go to my boss about this, I will get fired." You might be thinking "How will they ever trust me with something big again." You could also be thinking "what if I tell them I don't know what happened or how to fix it." I can tell you that there is a good chance that your manager in his career has most likely had some mistakes of this gravity also. He or she can probably relate to exactly where you are. If not, they will probably be more understanding than you think. More importantly a good manager will provide you the tools necessary to grow from this mistake.</p>

          <p>So as an employee let's take those two same examples as a above. Now the first example really hurts. We do not want to have to look at our superior and admit that we made a major mistake. The second example is a little less painful to have to admit and hopefully we can move past it faster. Let's look at what both of these mistakes do for us. The first has the greatest potential for growth. If we have to admit we made that big of a mistake the chances of wanting to learn the right way so as to never repeat it is very high. We are most likely never going to forget what went wrong when we are shown what should have happened. With that being said we also have the most room for growth in this mistake. We will learn a new skill, increase knowledge, and be able to help others in not repeating the same mistake. This in turn gives us humility, empathy and understanding for the next newer employee that might not see this mistake coming. In turn we are helping them avoid some of the pain we had to endure with that mistake. In the end training and growth occurred. The second example provides a team safety net if you will. We now intercepted the chance of a larger problem becoming devastating to the product. This in turn can lead to more knowledge and experience coming together to form a better product. This is what we think of when we look at reviews. Whether it is employee reviews, code reviews, product reviews or any other type of objective analysis. We are not here to point out the mistakes, but instead look at how can we improve what we have. This is one of those times when more than one employee will probably learn and walk away with a better ability than they entered with. Like in the last section when we look at it from a manager's stand point we start to see some similarities.</p>

          <p>As we think about our mistakes let's think them as learning opportunities. We still want those learning opportunities to not come at the cost of the product, company, or production cost as much as possible. We still want to train in the most safe and efficient methods as possible. Of course, we want all our training and education for each other to be in a structured environment, but mistakes will happen. When they do, let's look at them as opportunities not failures. Let's use those times to grow, learn, and teach each other how we can do better. Let's also do it with humility, empathy, and respect for each other. Let's pass on our previous mistakes to the new employees coming in. Therefore, I challenge you to embrace your mistake. Learn from your mistake. Most importantly let's help the new comer to not make the same mistake we made. If we adopt this mental attitude we will all grow by the end of the day and the end product will be the wow factor for the consumer no matter the industry we work in. Remember the wow factor builds stability for every level of the team.</p>

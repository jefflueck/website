          <h2>My Oops Log</h2>
          <br>
          <time>9/11/2018</time>

          <p>This month I would like to talk about the idea of keeping a log of mistakes. Now I know it is not comfortable or fun to look back at when we made a mistake. I am also not saying we should dwell on the past either but more importantly remember what we learned from our mistakes. So that being said let us take a look at what that might look like in a oops log.</p>

          <p>I know what you are wondering “what the heck is an oops log”. I like to think of it as a way to keep track of what you learned in the process of oops. Let us look at a systematic way you could do this.</p>

          <p>First you can start by logging in a chart or document what the mistake was. This should be detailed so that it paints a clear picture of what happened. You want to be able to look at this and be able to remember or be able to see what exactly went wrong in this instance.</p>

          <p>Now we want to log what the impact of the mistake was. This will help to paint the picture of the gravity of that mistake. Now I know this sounds somewhat demoralizing here. Trust me there will be light at the end of the process as we go, and you will see how we can turn this into a positive.</p>

          <p>Next, we want to next log the lesson learned from this event. This is where the positive of the mistake starts to take shape. We want to log how we grew from this experience. This allows us to see how well we were able to learn and bounce back from this mistake. It also gives us a log to help tell others about our experience to help them from falling into the same pitfall we just did.</p>

          <p>Lastly, we want to log the solution we used to fix the mistake. This is where the real value comes from this process in my opinion. Here we are building our future reference material in case we encounter this problem again. We are also building our confidence. Seeing that we found a plus from a potential negative gives us a sense of accomplishment. It also gives us the ability to see that there is a solution to what we thought might have been unfixable.</p>

          <p>Now I know this could be a long process. I am not saying that you have to do this for every mistake. I am also not saying that you should sacrifice production at the cost of this. You might decide you only want to do this for big mistakes. You might decide you want to do this only for a certain project. The choice is up to you. I am only suggesting this could be a tool to help see yourself grow in a particular area of your life. The decision is truly up to you. I find that reflecting and writing down things from time to time helps me grow. It is also encouraging for me to see how I have grown in a certain area. Therefore, I would say that the oops log can be a positive motivating experience under the right circumstances if you choose to look at it that way. I have found it to be a benefit to me and hope it can be to you as well.</p>

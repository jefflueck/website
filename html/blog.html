            <h2>The power of being humble</h2>
            <br>
            <time>4/9/2017</time>

            <p>As I have finished the mentorship stage of my education, this is a discipline I want to excel at my entire career, being humble.</p>

            <p>I have struggled with this in my current career as a newer firefighter, and it has been a hard lesson to swallow at times, granted I have learned to be much better at this skill in my current profession.  That being said, I think of the junior firefighters that come in to the department, and the ones I respect the most.  When they are willing to listen intently, to a veteran firefighter with a lot of years of experience, who want to try to teach them something, that carries huge respect and weight.</p>

            <p>I have tried to be that kind of humble in my learning and now as I enter the mentorship/education part of school, I am dedicated to being that type of new guy even more.  In my education I have found that this community is extremely willing to share their knowledge with new developers/students like myself.  I have learned so much from forums, my instructor, web communities, and even my fellow students.  I have also learned that being humble can, and will in my experience, bring you very far in this profession.  I have learned that as coders we love to share our new knowledge, and are a very open community.  This has made me love the struggles and accomplishments along the way.  That being said, I have been willing to listen to anyone that wants to share coding knowledge with me, and have looked to experience developers for guidance.</p>

            <p>So I know this might seem like an obvious skill, but has been difficult for me at times.  I feel that with this profession, and all of the wonderful people I have meet along the way, this is a skill that will be easy to hone.  So as this profession always has new technologies emerging, and continual learning required, I am ready to be even more humble.  The future of this profession is going to be an exciting one, and I am excited to be a part of it.</p>

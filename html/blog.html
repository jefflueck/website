          <h2>Why a Network Matters</h2>
          <br>
          <time>5/21/2018</time>

          <p>I know for some of this the title explains itself. For others of us we are probably thinking ok but how much does it matter? Others of us might not realize the power of what a network does. While this topic depending on where you are in life can have multiple meanings and even answers. I want to explore this month what this can mean in your career field and what it can bring to you in your career. I will take this as a high-level concept and not a career field specific topic.</p>

          <p>So that all being said I would like to break this down into some possible advantages of why a network matters and why we should cultivate them in our lives.</p>

          <p>The first and probably the easiest to see is the possible job opportunities that come from knowing individuals in a related field. When we look at how companies interact with each other the economy of business is truly worldwide in their interactions together. It is not uncommon for a company to get raw parts from a manufacture or get their tech services from another company that may or not be US based. It is not uncommon for companies to collaborate with other similar type of industries that work in the same space worldwide. That being said let’s look at how that can impact you as an employee while working in your current position. Let’s say that you are a developer for a company working on a project for a client. You might need to talk with another developer about a technology you are going to employee for that client to produce their product. Now we have that one to one connection with another possibly similar skilled individual. You might even talk to them multiple times and if you do might get to know you on a first name basis. You in that time have essentially presented your resume in working with that individual and they tend to remember what you did. Now that individual might talk to several other individuals and work with other companies that do similar work. Now we fast forward sometime from now and one of those distant interactions between the individual you worked with in the first place might be asked if they know any good developers as they look to expand. Now your name might be mentioned, and you get a call from a new prospective employer as a new opportunity presents itself. That network just gave you a job opportunity while all you did was do your original job to the best of your ability. This also in turn now might lead to more contacts and more opportunity as your network continues to grow.</p>

          <p>The next advantage I have personally found is that it expands your access to a knowledge base. Now this kind of explains itself but let’s dig into it a little deeper. When we look at branching out to others in the industry we work in, we bring in all kinds of levels of experience and knowledge. The world is becoming much more connected digitally giving us access to many individuals that can bring more knowledge to us if they are willing to share. There have been several different networking internet communication tools to connect and collaborate with people of similar job backgrounds to share, work side by side while being located very far away. What this means is the days of having to work in an office to get access to others with more experience and knowledge to grow and help is not as critical as it used to be. That being said I do think that does have a great amount of value don’t get me wrong. I am saying that there is more access to talent than ever before in our history. What does this mean for me you ask. In my experience with these tools I have found that I can pull from others when I run into a problem with something and use that to see if those individuals have some insight to my problem. It allows me to have different eyes with different backgrounds and experience to pull from. When I have used those tools, I found that not only do I gain production time in solving a problem I also learn a new skill to add to my ever-growing knowledge of a discipline. I also get the opportunity to have the answer explained to me in a deeper understanding of why it works. The other advantage is it relates to my first point in growing my network. That person might be willing to help me again and if an opportunity arises I might be the name that is passed on to another company or individual in that industry looking for a talented person to help expand their business.</p>

          <p>The last advantage I would like to talk about is community. Now as we look at the other advantages we talked about these bring us all measurable skills. This one does not but I feel still matters. When we interact with others of similar skills and passions about a specific topic it keeps us motivated. It also gives us a feeling of purpose in what we are trying to accomplish. I mean let’s face it no matter what you are doing it is easy to get down and feel like you are just in the weeds. When you have that community, you have others to relate to that can offer guidance and support for the dark days. We as humans are the most social creatures on the plant that’s probably not a surprise at this point. Let’s face it you can love your job have everything going for you but having that community to share with helps fuel your drive to accomplish even more. I think that we also have a responsibility to each other to help each other be the best we can be. I know I want to share what I learn with the others in my field of expertise to help see them learn, grow, and continue to come in with a passion at work for what they do. That is only accomplished through a community of people wanting to build each other up.</p>

          <p>In conclusion I look back at my experiences, the people along the way, and the individuals that have made a choice to invest in me. Without those individuals taking the time to help me I would not have had the opportunities I have today. That’s one of the many reasons I try to pass forward my knowledge to the newer generation of individuals of what I have learned to see them grow as well. As well as to keep them from making some of the same mistakes I have made. As a parent we do it with our kids all the time and we don’t think twice about it. That natural fostering should be applied here too. So next time you see an opportunity in your network, whatever that is seize it. Those network connections are like a bank account. The little bit of your knowledge and experience you keep putting in can produce huge dividends later.</p>

          <h2>Leadership Matters</h2>
          <br>
          <time>1/2/2019</time>

          <p>Welcome to the new year for starters. It has been a while since I put up a new blog, but I wanted the next one to be a good one. I have therefore taken a lot of time to think about what I can share with you that can make a positive impact for you in your day to day work life. In that time, I have come to the conclusion that we will talk about why leadership matters regardless of your current position in your company. Let us start 2019 with this concept and dig into what that can look like.</p>

          <p>In my current role I am a Lieutenant on a fire department and in charge of training and helping to direct a crew. Now with that being said I am also in charge of training the crew I work with on a variety of firefighting disciplines. Now I know that is a supervisory role, but I had decided long before that opportunity I was going to try to lead when I came to work. Now even though at the time I was not getting paid more to lead I decided to do that because I felt it was important and I wanted to be looked to as someone that could lead when needed. In doing this it gave me the ability to help be a resource to my coworkers. Let us look at why regardless of your level in your company the importance of leadership. I am going to look at this from two perspectives. One being management and one being non-management.</p>

          <p>Now regardless of where your work, what your company does, or what they produce there is a management structure. Now I will be the first to agree that a management structure needs to be present or nothing would probably ever get accomplished. Let us look at what leadership means in management. The more effective the manager above you is able to provide leadership the smother the operation will run. Leadership at this level means more than just having the answers. It means building trust with your coworkers so that they feel valued. It means that they feel you have their back. It means letting them know when they have done a good job and recognition for it. It means being available to help when needed without fear of discipline. I would argue it means having an open-door policy for your coworkers. It means making the hard decision when needed and standing by those when the higher management has questions or concerns. These are just some of the leadership qualities I have found to be effective in building a strong team around you. There are whole courses on this topic, and we could not cover them all in this blog. I just wanted to hit on some of the ones I have seen make a big impact.</p>

          <p>Now let’s look at the management level and how it can affect this. As a manager our job gets easier as we have long-term employees. If we can retain long-term employees, we have a team with a lot of experience. More experience means less problems we have to handle because the team can handle them themselves.  This also plays into employee retention. Employee retention matters because it is less training that needs to be spent on new employees. If we have to train a new employee that takes two people out of the mix. It will take an experienced employee out of the mix to train a new employee. That means now out of our employee force to accomplish a job we are down two individuals. Now employees leaving cannot entirely be avoided but I can tell you that when we look at very successful companies, they have very low turnover. Some of the best companies to work for are very hard to get a job at for that very reason. That is usually because the employees are valued and treated very well. They are usually paid well, and the management is good to work for. So that culture can be fostered by having good leadership in all management positions.</p>

          <p>Every company has employees, or it could not function. Companies have these structed different ways. For some companies it is a very straight line of employees from management down. For some companies it is organized in teams of teams assigned to a task. Some companies might have a pool of employees that get reassigned to teams based on the project needs. Whatever the dynamic is leading as an employee can also have a significant effect on how well the team functions. Now this can be a slippery slope when you are working with a team of equals so you will have to navigate this a little more carefully. When we talk about leading in this position, I have found the most effective way to do this is to first be available. When I was a firefighter and we got a new employee I just made sure that they knew they could come to me with questions. I also made sure that I was the most help possible when they did. I would also be a calming force when they made a mistake to ease their concerns if possible. I would not give an answer unless I was sure it was right as well as knowing that is what management wanted also. If I did now know the answer to their question, I would be honest about that and find the answer so I could come back with the right one. In this example it is important that you follow up with that fellow employee in a timely manner. I would also be accountable for my mistakes and take ownership of them. That included if I was even partially responsible for the mistake. Most importantly I would build a relationship with that employee. I would take the time to see how they were doing and try to be a listening post if needed. Now I know in the office this might be hard, so maybe you take a lunch together. While you are on lunch you can listen then.</p>

          <p>Now let’s do the same thing and see how this effects the team at the employee level. If it is done right it means more time out of your day. So, it is going to mean that you are going to have to be a really good manager of your own time. What you will see over time is that the team will run more smoothly. It is also going to probably mean that you are seeing the team handle more problems without help. This does a couple of things for your company dynamics. The management can now focus on improving the working environment for everyone. It also gives them the opportunity to be able to focus on getting new and exciting stuff for the team to work on. It also gives them a great selling pitch to corporate about all the great things the team is doing. The team will also gel and become stronger. It will increase the effectiveness and efficacy of the team. It will build retention inside the team. The longer the team is together the more they can anticipate each other and work better together. I have seen in my career a manager come to me as a firefighter and ask if something is done. Due to the fact that we built a close team, most of the time tasks were done without the supervisor even having to be involved. That’s makes it much easier when problems arise for your manager to go to bat for you. It also builds a lot of trust between your team and your manager.</p>

          <p>Now in conclusion these are only some of the ways you can lead regardless of your level in a company. There are several leadership qualities and again we cannot cover them all in this blog post. I only wanted to highlight some of the ones that I have found to be most effective in my case. What I can tell you is that if you have a desire to lead individuals at any level the more effective you are at your current level will make you even more effective at your next level. It is important to remember here that you even at your current level can improve a team or destroy a team. This is why the article is titled leadership matters. You have more power than you probably even realize to make this happen inside your team, your company, and effect the culture of the overall organization.  Therefore, don’t lose sight of leadership opportunities because it does matter at the end of the work week. You will also only get out what you put in to the team.</p>

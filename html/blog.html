          <h2>Team Dynamics and Why It Matters</h2>
          <br>
          <time>1/18/2018</time>

          <p>In my current career, I have recently had the privilege to be promoted to Lieutenant. With this comes more responsibility in my job duties, but more importantly my duties as a leader, trainer, and 1st tier supervisor. Now looking at my career as a whole I think it is important to point out that all of these were just as important before I had the official title, and I would argue even more important then. In emergency services, it can mean the safety of all firefighters on an emergency call, or something less severe like the efficiency of all firefighters on an emergency call. I know what you are thinking with those statements, but are they not the same thing? In reality, they are not and have different out comes.</p>

          <p>For example, let’s look at the first point. If a fellow firefighter has not been shown or trained properly, he or she can make a decision that in turn could hurt or kill a fellow firefighter working on scene. If that person for example is unable to properly send the correct pressure down a fire hose line to a firefighter on the other end fighting a fire what happens. In this example, the firefighter on the end could be killed or severally injured due to not having enough water being applied to the fire.</p>

          <p>Now let’s look at the second point. On an emergency event, it is important that a team of firefighters are on the same page and are able to know what each individual will need to do in a safe, rapid fashion. It is important in this example that there are predefined roles, responsibilities, and expectations for each firefighter in that team when they get to the scene.  Each member has to know what to expect out of each other, who is doing what, and trust that they have the knowledge, and skills to perform that responsibility given. They also need to be able to trust that it can be done quickly, safely, and efficiently with little direction. This meshing of personnel in this example resolves the emergency with preventing further loss to the property and less displacement of citizens affected.</p>

          <p>Now let’s take these same concepts and apply them to a web development team atmosphere. The weight of severity is not the same but the impact to the growth, stability, and profit of a company is. Now if you are a member of a team you are probably thinking well this is a management problem why do I care? I see it apply right away in four ways. First as a team member I see it apply in it relates to me getting paid. Second thing it applies to my job security. Third it applies in helping my co-workers and myself grow to be a better team of developers. Finally, I see that I do not need to be a supervisor to be able to make an impact on the team in any of these ways. Training, sharing knowledge, mentorship, and an attitude to improve each other starts with the new hire. As a supervisor, we want to see guys, and gals build each other up. It is important to further each other personally and professionally. The reason is, coming back the second point at the beginning of this journey, now we are more efficient. When my title was firefighter, I loved sharing and teaching my knowledge to the new firefighter. I took ownership and pride of what I knew. I wanted to share my knowledge to the next guy to build a better firefighter alongside me. As a working developer on a team you have knowledge, and experience the new hire might not have. When you teach a fellow developer something you learned, and that developer has a new skill the team efficiency increased. This means production increased which in turn means performance of the company increased. The natural byproduct of this is that the company can now perform more work and build more profit. In turn, this team dynamic is starting to come full circle. When there is more everyone in the team can do, the company can take on more contracts, the company is now profitable, and your job is now more secure. Also, the supervisor now notices a more motivated individual. You now have put yourself, your fellow developers in a position to increase your earnings, position in the company, and overall happiness in working together. When a team, regardless of profession, has good team dynamics everyone benefits from the top down. The team needs to stop less, gets to code more, can anticipate each other’s needs, see pitfalls before they become a problem, and produce a great product. This helps your reputation in the community you work in, your team is seen as leaders in their field, and the company is seen as progressive, with a high caliber of individuals working there. This in turn naturally brings more talented individuals to the team, and fosters a place where all developers want to work and learn.</p>

          <p>So, I challenge you, regardless of your position, help level up your coworker. Remember, being the new person can be terrifying for some individuals. Embrace the new hire, take personnel stock in making that individual the best he, or she can be.</p>

          <p>So today when you come to work look at each other and start with investing in each other’s success! It has been my experience some of the best knowledge I ever gained was from some of the newest hires with fresh ideas, and techniques of doing things.</p>

          <p>Remember at the end of the day, this allows the company to find more exciting projects for all of the team to work on next. I encourage you to be the changing force in your team, and I think you will find that you can more impact overall than you ever thought. You might also find coming to work is more fun than it was yesterday. Remember at the end of the day, regardless of your position, this community can only be as good as we challenge ourselves make it. Take the challenge, and build something amazing! </p>

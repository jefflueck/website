        <h2>Don’t repeat history</h2>
        <br>
        <time>2/9/2019</time>

        <p>This month I would like to tackle the age-old problem of don’t repeat history. Now I am not saying don’t ever
            make mistakes because that would be impossible. What I would rather look at this month is the good and bad
            of making mistakes. I would like to start by saying that we try to not repeat these mistakes time and time
            again. Now I will be the first to admit we will make a mistake more than once from time to time. What we
            want to do is to try to reduce how many times this happens. We should as well be striving to learn from our
            peers and work community from their mistakes.</p>

        <p>In my current line of work when we have a firefighter injury or line of duty death the first thing that
            happens is an investigation. During that investigation an independent agency looks at what went right, what
            went wrong, and how different decisions and factors could have reduced the injury or prevented the death.
            This last section of the report is called lessons learned. Usually at this point of the investigation the
            head of the affected department is able to see the result of the investigation and this section is
            collaborative effort between the two entities. Once this is complete it is released as public record for
            other fire departments to read and learn from. This allows other departments to be able to learn and help
            prevent this from happening to them if possible.</p>

        <p>Now in your current job you might not have to deal with decisions that carry this much weight and I hope you
            do not. Still I would argue that in whatever business you run we should all try to commit to memory the
            lessons learned in our own industry. This will afford us all time to make more progress in accomplishing our
            end goal. It will make our team more effective as a group and our production time more effective. We will
            probably see more products delivered over time.</p>

        <p>Let us look at the obvious and not so obvious costs of mistakes. In this section we will list and explore the
            obvious cost of the mistakes first. The first and probably most obvious is production time. When we make a
            mistake, we lose production time because someone needs to take the time to correct it. Now that being said
            this could mean we have to go back and fix a mistake. This then holds up the rest of the team, or several
            people on the team that now have to work on fixing the mistake. The second is a byproduct of the first. That
            is the loss in production time. We touched on this but let’s look at it a little more deeply here. The loss
            in production time means dollars for the company. It also means the reputation of the company. Now instead
            of making the deadline we told the client we now have to go back and tell them it is going to take more
            time. This also means damage control with the client, so we do not lose them. The third can have long term
            damaging effects. The third is the emotional hit we take because of the mistake. Let’s face it no matter how
            much we want to deny it, we care about our job and the work we do. This therefore can have long term affects
            in our drive to want to do good work. We can see ourselves slow down and doubt all of our actions going
            forward. This causes us to lose trust in our own abilities. We want to be confident in our abilities on the
            team so we can be a valuable member of the team.</p>

        <p>Now let us look at the not so obvious results of the mistakes. These in the end can actually help us to
            become a better team member. The first is you just got an opportunity to learn something. I think we can all
            remember when we made a pretty major mistake at our jobs. One of the natural results of this is we make a
            big mental note to make sure we commit this mistake to memory, so we do not repeat it. I know in my own
            career when I have made a major mistake the first thing, I say to myself is “well I’m never going to do that
            again”. The second of this result is that we were just given an opportunity to teach another team member the
            mistake, so they do not fall into the same trap. I have had times, even very recently where I have been able
            to share a mistake with a coworker, so they did not have to make the same one. They now know that if they
            have that same type of scenario that doing what I might have done would not be a good option. Now another
            person on the team has collective knowledge that they can share with someone else. Third is the opportunity
            to rescue. If you see a team member going down a road that you can see will lead to a mistake that you have
            made you can help redirect them before damage is done. Now you have some inside knowledge to share with them
            because you can explain that you have made the same mistake they were about to make. The last one I want to
            share might be a little obvious at this point. This one is that you just grew a little bit in making a
            mistake. Now you know something that you did not know before and the result of that decision. Your knowledge
            base just grew in what you are doing. In that you now have technical knowledge you did not have before.</p>

        <p>In wrapping up this blog I want you to realize there are two sides to making a mistake. Some of these
            mistakes have positive results as you saw. I also want you to think about what happens when we repeat the
            same mistakes. These results good or bad happen each time that you repeat a previous mistake. We should
            therefore strive to not repeat the same mistake, so we do not have to go through the same good and bad
            result again. It is easy to say but hard to do. I will be the first to admit that it cannot be entirely
            avoided but it can be reduced.</p>

          <h2>What Can I Do</h2>
          <br>
          <time>7/19/2018</time>

          <p>I know it is easy to get caught up in the day to day of your work and responsibilities. I am as guilty as everyone else when it comes to seeing my small picture of what I am responsibility for and have to get done. In this blog I would like to look at the concept of what can I do regardless of position in your team. I am not saying you should try to everyone elseâ€™s job in the office, or that they are not doing theirs. What I am saying is there are ways by doing some small things the entire team benefits and is more productive. It does require that we all leave our egos at the door which can also be hard to do and see the others on the team as just as valuable as you in accomplishing the end goal.</p>

          <p>One of the easiest things to do is not wait for a task to be assigned. One of the things that can really bog down a team is when someone completes a task and just sits and waits for someone to give them something else to do. There are a lot of applications now for team members to see all of the tasks that need to be accomplished to finish a full job. If you see that you have finished something and there is something that needs to be done take that task on. If you see something is assigned to someone and they have other tasks that they are working on ask them if you can do something to help free them up. These are small things but can have a huge impact on helping the team get to the end goal a lot faster. Supervisors also notice this and tend to remember when you go ask for a raise. It also gives you more to say when they ask you why you should be given a raise or promotion.</p>

          <p>You can also try to anticipate what is needed next. If you are caught up and can see the project is going to probably need something you can approach your supervisor and ask if this will be needed. It is easy for a supervisor to get bogged down in his responsibilities and not see that new thing coming down the road of the project before you do. If you are in the trenches you probably see this coming. This allows the supervisor to see you are anticipating the projects growth and design. It allows you to demonstrate that you are invested in the successful outcome of the project and quality of the end product. It also gives you the opportunity to work that new piece of the project since you have the time and it does not become a task to a team member that might already be busy with a current long task list. It also shows your supervisor you have ambition and foresight as a team member. Supervisors also remember this down the road as well.</p>

          <p>You can try to solve problems in a project before they become a problem with a good designed solution. Every project and team member working on a project will run into problems as they work towards a goal. If you can see that something in the project will be a problem, you can then start to solve it. You can approach the team and explain the problem you see coming in the current project and then give a suggested solution. This allows you to save project time as you are proposing a solution before the problem appears. It also allows you to pool team knowledge and experience to see if that solution is the best or if there is a better one. The team will appreciate that someone is looking ahead and trying to head off a headache in the project down the road. This is one of those that like I said in the beginning of the article leaving the ego at the door. That can be hard to do but is necessary to the health and quality of the team. The better this works inside the team the easier the supervisors job becomes. The easier the supervisors job becomes the more he/she can focus on the job of providing the tools and time the team needs to complete the project. It also is a huge factor in employee retention and building experience among the team. Remember you are only as good as the guy/girl next to you because you need each other.</p>

          <p>Now these are not all the things you can do to help your team accomplish the end goal. This is one of those blogs that could be fifty pages long. These are all soft skills you should be working on every day in any job. There are entire books written on this subject. I only wanted to bring a couple of ideas to your attention to get the juices flowing when you go back to your team. There are a lot of soft skills that you can do as an employee and team member. I think the longer you work somewhere the harder it is to remember to do this every day. I will be the first to admit it is hard to try to pay attention to all of these types of things day in and day out. I can say from experience that when I make it a point to try to do this I can see a difference in the team productivity and dynamics. I hope this helps to broaden your outlook when you return to your team. For me just writing this blog has caused me to review how I can be a better asset to my team when I return to work.</p>

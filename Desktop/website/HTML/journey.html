            <h2>Walk With Me!</h2>
        
            <p>I want to thank you for coming along this far in exploring my walk in web development.  So this has been an interesting walk to say the least.  I currently am a career firefighter and have been doing that profession for twenty years now.  In that time, I have married and had a couple of kids with my loving wife.  Now that, as most Dads will tell you, changes your outlook on life and what you want for your kids.</p>
                
            <p>I have always had a love for computers and how they function.  The first experience of that being the old Apple II E that my grade school had and this was shared with all five grades.  The only thing that I ever saw it used for was to play Oregon Trail that I can remember.  Now, since that time I have seen computers and computing software make massive leaps.  This grew my interest in computers, so I approached a good friend a year ago, who is a web developer, and said &quot;so what is this web development job all about&quot;.  I also talked with some boot academies and local colleges in my area.  The more I listened and the more I found out the more I fell in love with the challange of making professional websites.  I spent a year and some change talking with all those people and getting a real, no fluff look at what that involves.  I also got to learn what a day for a web developer looks like and felt that I really wanted to do this and be part of that community.</p>

            <p>So now this is where the hard part of my walk began.  Due to my current place in life and situation, I went the self-paced online school route with Udemy. I also bought books on web design and web programming languages.  I have completed a full stack web developer course on Udemy, and now I am enrolled in a local classroom coding school called Code Convoy.  I also have started another full stack development course on Udemy as well.  I also bought individual courses through Udemy on several languages that are relevant to a web development career to continue to learn more core languages when I have finished my current course. I plan to continue learning while I wait for an opportunity to be employed in Web Development to continue to build my knowledge base.</p>
                
            <p>So as I continue to make this journey, I am learning, loving, and enjoying the challenge of learning a new skill.  This has been a hard, but very rewarding walk.  I have had great help along the way, and continued support during my travel.  So like most things that I found in my life the work is hard, but the reward is massive.  Also I know that in this field of study your journey is never done, and that excites me to be able to continue to learn and grow.  So I want to thank you for looking at my walk so far and hope you will check this page again from time to time, as my walk will progress and change.  If you are a developer reading this, I am sure there is a part of this walk or a few parts you can relate to in this, and I hope you feel the same as I do.  To create something on a web canvas is an amazing feeling of accomplishment, and I am looking forward to being part of the Web Development community.</p>
